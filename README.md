Langauges used
2. Our project idea is to create a database for a flower shop. This platform will give us an 
opportunity to track the inventory of a flower shop. This will also organize flowers at the 
shop along with any other related products that will be sold, such as vases and bows.
3. Our project will have the entities for a flower shop, product, flowers, vases, and bows. 
We plan to implement a union between the product and the different types of products. 
As such, we will be using an ID in the product table that will use triggers when updating, 
inserting, or deleting the different types of products.
4. We will be hosting this project on the ECS servers.


The URL of your github repo that contains both your backend and front end code. Make sure this repo is publicly accessible -- if I cannot access it during grading you will not receive credit. In your github readme
Links to an external site. be sure to give the full path to the file or files that handle your SQL inserts and selects. Be sure to use prepared statements for your inserts. Do not add more code after the due date of this assignment -- this will cause the entire submission to be late. Be sure your code is easy to read, well formatted, and contains appropriate comments.
Remember that you cannot use a framework for your SQL table creation, inserts or selects here. You must use raw SQL.
The URL of your publicly accessible website. This website will not be judged on how it looks -- don't spend time making it pretty! However it must contain the following elements, which must all work correctly:

    A single text box where I can enter a value that will be inserted into one of the tables of your database. It's your choice what table and what column. If you are expecting data that is not random text, be sure to give me a visual clue what you are expecting. Points will be deducted if I have to guess at data types or domains.
    A single table showing all the columns and rows of the table associated with the text box.
    A submit button that will insert the value I enter and update the table with the new data from the database.
